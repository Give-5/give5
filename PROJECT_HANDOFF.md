### Environment Variables Required

NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
```

## Critical Implementation Details

### Authentication Flow
1. Users sign up with email/password
2. Supabase sends confirmation email (currently required)
3. Database trigger creates profile and rewards records
4. Auth context manages session state
5. Middleware protects authenticated routes

### Known Issues and Solutions
1. **Email Confirmation**: Supabase requires email confirmation by default. Consider disabling for development.
2. **Test User Cleanup**: Previous test users may have invalid auth records. Clean via Supabase dashboard.
3. **Loading States**: Some pages show brief loading screens during auth checks.

### Design Patterns Established
1. **Component Structure**: Functional components with TypeScript
2. **Styling**: Tailwind utilities with design tokens from `/lib/styles`
3. **State Management**: React Context for auth, local state for components
4. **Data Fetching**: Ready for React Query or SWR integration
5. **Error Handling**: Basic try-catch, needs error boundaries

## Development Workflow

### Daily Development Process
1. Check `CLAUDE.md` for coding guidelines
2. Run `npm run dev` to start development server
3. Make changes following established patterns
4. Run `npm run lint` before committing
5. Test features manually and with Playwright
6. Update component showcase for new components

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Set up but not implemented
- **E2E Tests**: Playwright configured, some auth tests written
- **Visual Tests**: Configured but needs baseline screenshots
- **Manual Testing**: Primary method currently used

### Deployment Checklist
- [ ] Set up Vercel project
- [ ] Configure environment variables
- [ ] Set up Supabase production project
- [ ] Run database migrations
- [ ] Configure custom domain
- [ ] Set up monitoring

## Important Notes

### Security Considerations
- Never commit `.env.local` file
- Use RLS policies for all database access
- Validate all user inputs
- Implement rate limiting for API routes
- Regular security audits recommended

### Performance Considerations
- Images are optimized with Next.js Image component
- Implement lazy loading for event lists
- Use pagination for large datasets
- Consider caching strategies
- Monitor bundle size

### Maintenance Tasks
- Keep dependencies updated
- Regular database backups
- Monitor error logs
- Update documentation
- Review and optimize queries

## Conclusion

The Give5 platform has a solid foundation with authentication, UI, and database schema complete. The immediate focus should be on connecting the frontend to the backend with real data, implementing core volunteer features, and preparing for initial user testing. The modular architecture and comprehensive design system provide a strong base for rapid feature development.

Remember to maintain code quality, follow established patterns, and update documentation as new features are added. Good luck with the continued development of Give5!
